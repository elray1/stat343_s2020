 * Data Model: $X_1, \ldots, X_5 \simiid \text{Normal}(\theta, 5^2)$

 * We saw that the likelihood ratio test is *equivalent* to a test based on $\bar{x}$.  The p-value is $P(\bar{X} \leq \bar{x} | \theta = 25)$ ("extreme" values of $\bar{x}$ are those that are at least as small as $\bar{x}$)

 * The *power* of the test is $P(\text{reject } H_0 | H_0 \text{ incorrect})$

#### 1. Consider a test of the hypotheses $H_0: \theta = 25$ vs. $H_A: \theta = 20$.  Below is a picture showing the pdf $f_{\bar{X}|\theta}(\bar{x} | 20)$ of a $\text{Normal}(20, 5^2/5)$ distribution and the pdf $f_{\bar{X}|\theta}(\bar{x} | 25)$ of a $\text{Normal}(25, 5^2/5)$ distribution, along with a vertical line at $q_5^{null}$, the 5th percentile of the $\text{Normal}(25, 5^2/5)$ distribution.

 * **Shade in the area corresponding to $1 - \beta$, the power of the likelihood ratio test if $H_A$ is correct.**
 * **Show how you would calculate the power of the test as an integral of either $f_{\bar{X}|\theta}(\bar{x} | 20)$ or $f_{\bar{X}|\theta}(\bar{x} | 25)$**

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 1.5, fig.width = 7}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(0, 35)), mapping = aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 25, sd = sqrt(5))) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 20, sd = sqrt(5))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = qnorm(0.05, mean = 25, sd = sqrt(5))) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(10, 35), expand = TRUE) +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab(expression(bar(x))) +
  ylab("density")
```

#### 2. Suppose that instead we were testing the hypotheses $H_0: \theta = 25$ vs. $H_A: \theta = 22.5$. Below is a picture showing the pdf $f_{\bar{X}|\theta}(\bar{x} | 22.5)$ of a $\text{Normal}(22.5, 5^2/5)$ distribution and the pdf $f_{\bar{X}|\theta}(\bar{x} | 25)$ of a $\text{Normal}(25, 5^2/5)$ distribution, along with a vertical line at $q_5^{null}$, the 5th percentile of the $\text{Normal}(25, 5^2/5)$ distribution.

 * **Shade in the area corresponding to $1 - \beta$, the power of the likelihood ratio test if $H_A$ is correct.**
 * **Show how you would calculate the power of the test as an integral of either $f_{\bar{X}|\theta}(\bar{x} | 22.5)$ or $f_{\bar{X}|\theta}(\bar{x} | 25)$**

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 1.5, fig.width = 7}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(0, 35)), mapping = aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 25, sd = sqrt(5))) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 22.5, sd = sqrt(5))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = qnorm(0.05, mean = 25, sd = sqrt(5))) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(10, 35), expand = TRUE) +

#### 3. Suppose that instead we were testing the hypotheses $H_0: \theta = 25$ vs. $H_A: \theta = 17.5$. Below is a picture showing the pdf $f_{\bar{X}|\theta}(\bar{x} | 17.5)$ of a $\text{Normal}(17.5, 5^2/5)$ distribution and the pdf $f_{\bar{X}|\theta}(\bar{x} | 25)$ of a $\text{Normal}(25, 5^2/5)$ distribution, along with a vertical line at $q_5^{null}$, the 5th percentile of the $\text{Normal}(25, 5^2/5)$ distribution.

 * **Shade in the area corresponding to $1 - \beta$, the power of the likelihood ratio test if $H_A$ is correct.**
 * **Show how you would calculate the power of the test as an integral of either $f_{\bar{X}|\theta}(\bar{x} | 17.5)$ or $f_{\bar{X}|\theta}(\bar{x} | 25)$**

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 1.5, fig.width = 7}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(0, 35)), mapping = aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 25, sd = sqrt(5))) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 17.5, sd = sqrt(5))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = qnorm(0.05, mean = 25, sd = sqrt(5))) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(10, 35), expand = TRUE) +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab(expression(bar(x))) +
  ylab("density")
```

#### 4. For which of the alternative hypotheses above ($\theta = 17.5$, $\theta = 20$, or $\theta = 22.5$) is the power of the test largest?  For which is the power smallest?
