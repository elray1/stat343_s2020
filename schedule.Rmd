#### Wed, Jan 22
 * **In class**, we will work on:
    * Discuss [syllabus](syllabus/syllabus_stat_343.pdf), overview of course
    * Review of prerequisites
        * Topics from probability: [pdf](resources/probability/probability.pdf) (also posted on resources page)
        * Practice examples for probability: [pdf](materials/20200122_probability/probability_practice.pdf) Solutions: [pdf](materials/20200122_probability/probability_practice_sol.pdf)
        * Common probability distributions: [pdf](resources/probability/probability_distributions.pdf) (also posted on resources page; you don't need to memorize this material)
        * Topics from calculus (not discussed today, please review after class): [pdf](resources/calculus/calculus.pdf) (also posted on resources page)
 * **After class**, please do the following:
    * **Register for GitHub** [here](https://github.com) if you haven't already; I will ask you to provide your GitHub user name in the questionairre below.
    * **Fill out** a brief [questionnairre](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfw9sGTYsHaA9D0NEuxLVVdD4QlQXDk59DFu0-E6KxLtnEhxw/viewform?usp=sf_link) (if you are taking two classes with me, you only need to fill out this questionairre once)
    * **Fill out** this brief [poll about when my office hours should be held](https://zvite.co/i/JbeK8Cyi) (if you are taking two classes with me, you only need to fill out this poll once)
    * **Sign up** for our class at Piazza (anonymous question and answer forum): [https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2020/stat343](https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2020/stat343)
    * **Reading**
        * Review the prerequisite material from probability and calculus.  If there are any topics from probability that you don't have memorized, please start memorizing them.  This will make the rest of this class go much more smoothly for you.  If you have any questions on this material, please don't hesitate to ask me in office hours or on Piazza.  I am happy to help with this material.
        * Over the next 1 or 2 classes we will cover material from Chapter 6 of the text.  Give those sections in the book a brief skim.
    * **Homework 0** due 5 pm Mon, Jan 27


#### Fri, Jan 24
 * **In class**, we will work on:
    * Wrap up any remaining probability examples from last class
    * Define the $t$, $F$, and $\\chi^2$ distributions; this material is in Chapter 6 of Rice.  Lecture notes: [pdf](materials/20200124_chisq_t_F/lecture_notes.pdf) **Note that there is a minor error in the lecture notes that we did not make in class:** on page 5, the denominator should be the square root of a chi squared random variable divided by its degrees of freedom.  Basically, we need to take the square root of the square of the denominator to see that we have a t-distributed random variable.
    * Lab 01.  See labs page for solutions.
 * **After class**, please:
    * **Reading:** Over the next few classes we will cover material from Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.5 of the text.  Give those sections in the book a brief skim.
    * **Homework 0** due 5 pm Mon, Jan 27

        * We had a few extra minutes so we also defined an estimator (a random variable) and estimate (realized value of an estimator based on a sample, a number).
 * **After class**, please:
    * **Reading:** Over the next few classes we will cover material from Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.5 of the text.  Give those sections in the book a brief skim.

You only need to know the informal statement of the Central Limit Theorem.
    * More on maximum likelihood estimation:

We'll review this at the beginning of class on Wednesday too.
