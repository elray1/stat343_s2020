#### Wed, Jan 22
 * **In class**, we will work on:
    * Discuss [syllabus](syllabus/syllabus_stat_343.pdf), overview of course
    * Review of prerequisites
        * Topics from probability: [pdf](resources/probability/probability.pdf) (also posted on resources page)
        * Practice examples for probability: [pdf](materials/20200122_probability/probability_practice.pdf)
        * Common probability distributions: [pdf](resources/probability/probability_distributions.pdf) (also posted on resources page; you don't need to memorize this material)
        * Topics from calculus (not discussed today, please review after class): [pdf](resources/calculus/calculus.pdf) (also posted on resources page)
 * **After class**, please do the following:
    * **Register for GitHub** [here](https://github.com) if you haven't already; I will ask you to provide your GitHub user name in the questionairre below.
    * **Fill out** a brief [questionnairre](https://goo.gl/forms/qFlzOcikqxAkDrJE2)
    * **Fill out** this brief [poll about when my office hours should be held](http://whenisgood.net/n4ahdz3)
    * **Sign up** for our class at Piazza (anonymous question and answer forum): [https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2020/stat343](https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2020/stat343)
    * **Reading**
        * Review the prerequisite material from probability and calculus.  If there are any topics from probability or calculus that you don't have memorized, please start memorizing them.  This will make the rest of this class go much more smoothly for you.  If you have any questions on this material, please don't hesitate to ask me in office hours or on Piazza.  I am happy to help with this material.
        * Over the next 1 or 2 classes we will cover material from Chapter 6 of the text.  Give those sections in the book a brief skim.
    * **Homework 0** due 5 pm Mon, Jan 27


#### Fri, Jan 24
 * **In class**, we will work on:
    * Wrap up any remaining probability examples from last class
    * Define the $t$, $F$, and $\\chi^2$ distributions
 * **After class**, please:
    * **Reading:** Over the next few classes we will cover material from Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.5 of the text.  Give those sections in the book a brief skim.

#### Mon, Jan 27
 * **In class**, we will work on:
    * If necessary, finish defining the $t$, $F$, and $\\chi^2$ distributions
    * Start on maximum likelihood estimation
 * **After class**, please:
    * **Reading:** Over the next few classes we will cover material from Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.5 of the text.  Give those sections in the book a brief skim.
    * **Homework 0** due 5 pm **today**, Mon, Jan 27

#### Wed, Jan 29
 * **In class**, we will work on:
    * **Quiz** on probability background.  This will be very similar to HW 0.  Please memorize everything on the \"Topics from probability\" document linked on the Resources page, and know how to use it.  You only need to know the informal statement of the Central Limit Theorem.
    * More on maximum likelihood estimation
 * **After class**, please:
    * **Reading:** Continue working through Section 8.5.  Also give Section 8.4 a brief skim.
    * **Homework 1** due 5 pm Wed, Feb 5


#### Fri, Jan 31
 * **In class**, we will work on:
    * Either more on maximum likelihood estimation, or method of moments.
 * **After class**, please:
